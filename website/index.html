            <p>
                The primary goal of our project was to create a highly generalizable 3D particle simulator.  Many physically accurate particle models of water, fire, and other systems have been made, but often alone in a vacuum.  Our aim was to create a system that could handle many simulation types, as well as the interaction between them.  A tangential aim of this project was related to pixel-art animation.  Pixel-art is difficult, and animating it in a believable way even more so, but the popular indie video game dead cells found a way around this by using a 3D rendering pipeline to create 2D pixel animations.  So in addition to the particle simulation and physics, we attempt to append post-processing steps towards this secondary aim.

            <p>
                We designed our program around taking in JSON files to supply the parameters to define our simulation scenes. Some of the parameters that we want to control, for example, are the number of particle clouds, how many particles are in each, the masses and radii, their colors, and unique collision and attraction properties between different particle types. We can also control parameters for our Marching Cubes algorithm and the locations of primitives such as planes and spheres in the scene. *It seems like there are a lot more features since I wrote it, so feel free to change or rewrite this section*
            </p>
            <h5 class = "py-3 text-center">The Particle Simulation</h5>
            <p>
                Once the particle start positions and class information has been loaded the physics loop begins.  A key feature of this simulation is the ParticleProperties class which stores the forces received by particles of its type from other types.  Because we have the potential for many different particle types to be used together, we use this as a way to keep track of the class properties since we cannot hardcode any interactions.  This class maintains pointers to the necessary force functions, and also stores the force with which it operates between any 2 given particles.

            <p>
                Our final demonstration for the project was a simulation containing fire, water, and steam.  First fire appears to blaze from the ground, only to be extinguished by water, before rising up as steam.  In describing how this simulation works, we can showcase the inner workings of our simulation system.  Fire was modeled using both an external and internal force.  In our system external forces are a constant force vector applied to the particle, while internal forces occur between particles.  Each piece calculates the forces it receives from other particles, which is dependent on their type.  Fire had an external force downward to simulate gravity, and internal upwards force that came from other particles of the same type.  This internal force was also localized, meaning that only nearby particles affected it, and not all in the simulation.  We added localized forces to reduce computation, as not all forces need to be calculated on every particle.  This was done using box hashing similar to the one used in project 4.  Overall, the force on the fire particles would be:
            </p>
            <p class="text-center py-2">$f = G * <0, -1, 0> + F * \sum_{n} \frac{<0, 1, 0>}{r}$</p>
            <p>
                where $n$ is the set of particles in the same box as the current one and $r$ is the distance between them.  Here $F$ and $G$ are strength constants defined by manual trial and error.
