        <h1>Dynamic Point-Cloud Based Pixel Rendering Simulation</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, we will generate real-time animated meshes by applying the point cloud to mesh algorithm to a particle simulation. 
            We will then run this result through a custom rasterizer to generate fluid pixel art animations.

        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Making high quality pixel art is incredibly difficult and time consuming, and to animate it frame by frame traditionally requires 
            exponentially more effort and a level of artistry that we do not have. 3D animations are potentially more approachable, as they can 
            be represented using motion curves or kinematics. But to have a truly dynamic rendering, we thought it would be appropriate to 
            generate our meshes using particle simulations. Notably, we opted to rasterize meshes instead of the particle simulation itself so 
            that we could still experiment with a cel-shaded look, common in traditional pixel art.
        </p>
        <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>Plan to deliver:</h3>
        <p>
            At the most basic level, we will apply the point cloud to mesh algorithm on predetermined point cloud data, resulting in a 
            dynamically generated mesh which can be shaded and lit (though not necessarily generated in real-time). From there, we would 
            render it using the custom rasterizer to create a final output video of the mesh being animated using basic transformations, 
            which would showcase a fluid pixel art animation. Our metrics for success (and the points we want to analyse) are the fluidity 
            of the animation, avoiding noise in the pixel rendering (but not necessarily avoiding aliasing since pixel art tends to have 
            sharp edges), and having smooth shading on the mesh output from the point cloud algorithm. Our hope is that by removing the 
            real-time element and ignoring the particle simulation input, we can dedicate our efforts to making an effective point cloud 
            to mesh algorithm which generates “smooth” surfaces for our pixel rasterizer to render. 
        </p>
        <h3>Hope to deliver:</h3>
        <p>
            If we are able to, we believe that having the point cloud input data be generated dynamically using a particle simulation would 
            make for a much more interesting animation, although it would work best if the particle simulation was realistic and abided by 
            some natural physical properties (presumably including some degree of cohesion), in order for the mesh to remain smooth. Given 
            the setup of the project, the particle simulation aspect is completely independent from the rendering, which is why we are 
            willing to forgo this aspect if the point cloud to mesh aspect proves to be too time consuming.
